Introduction
==============

I'm the Chief Executive Developer at `Level 12 <https://www.level12.io/>`_.

I've been programming
for 15 years and working directly with customers to build custom software for 12 years.

Level 12 is on a mission to rid the world of chaos one software project at a time.

Agile methodologies make our customers happy...really, really, happy.

Waterfall Project Management
============================

- Waterfall: a sequential (non-iterative) process in which each phase of
  development is completed before moving on to the next.
- It originates in manufacturing & construction industries

Agile Project Management
============================

- Agile: an incremental and iterative approach to development that values close collaboration
  and small development cycles.
- It originated as a response to the typical waterfall approach and high failure rate of IT projects.


Agile

Agile is not Scrum
===================

Agile is a philosophy, not a methodology. Some methodologies:

- Scrum
- Extreme programming (XP)
- LEAN

Agile Principles: Software
==========================

* Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of **valuable software**
* **Working software** is the principal measure of progress
* Continuous attention to **technical excellence** and good design

Agile Principles: Agility
==========================

* **Welcome changing requirements**, even in late development
* Working software is **delivered frequently** (weeks rather than months)
* **Sustainable development**, able to maintain a constant pace

Agile Principles: People
===============================

* Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
* Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
* Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
* Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly
* Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams

Agile Essentials
================

A software development process that is:

* Collaborative: frequent and productive interaction between business and development
* Dynamic: change is welcomed with minimal friction
* High velocity: short iterations & frequent delivery (days/weeks)
* Excellent: predictably high quality


More than the sum of it's parts
===============================

Synergy.


Risks in Software Development
=============================

* Missed Deadlines
* Over Budget
* Missing Functionality

Anything missing?

Make a guess on success/failure rate?


Project Success Rate
====================

* 39% succeed (delivered on time, on budget, and with required functionality)
* 43% are challenged (late, over budget, and/or with fewer than the required features and functions)
* 18% fail (canceled or never used)

Why so low?  Digging, APIs, and file formats.


The Agile Difference
====================

.. csv-table::
   :header: "", "Low Agility", "High Agility"
   :widths: 50, 25, 25

   "Met goals/business intent", "56%", "75%"
   "Finished on time", "40%", "65%"
   "Finished within budget", "45%", "67%"
   "Complete strategic initiatives", "45%", "69%"

Agile organizations grow revenue 37% faster and generate 30% higher
profits than non-agile companies.


An Analogy
==================

Let's build a tank.
