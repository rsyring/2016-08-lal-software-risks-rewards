Custom Software Risks & Rewards: Protecting ROI using Agile methods
===================================================================

The slides for my presentation at the "Lunch & Learn" [Level 12](https://www.level12.io)
hosted in the Fall of 2016.

Summary
-------

We'll take a close look at the relationship between agile workflows and automated software testing.  We'll discuss how automated tests impact software being an asset, expense, or liability (metaphorically speaking).  We will then explore automated testing best practices and how to get started writing tests.

Event Description
-----------------

Effective business software is essential to an organization’s profitability. Is your business losing valuable time working around poorly performing software or software that is not in-step with your organization’s workflows? Are you frustrated that you are unable to quickly access the data and reports you need for business critical decisions?

Custom software can deliver incredible ROI for your organization. When the cost of custom software is a fraction of what you’re losing in productivity, you have immediate ROI. Think of it: software that fits your organization without unneeded complexity or bloatware and that reduces your costs to operate. But there are risks with custom software, so how is that ROI protected?

Enter Agile.  Agile software development is a different way of managing IT development teams and projects.  It's a philosophy that emphasizes:

* Collaboration: communication and progress visibility
* Velocity: quick development cycle iterations (usually measured in weeks)
* Flexibility: welcome and quickly respond to changing business needs
* Quality: working software is the primary measure of progress
* Automated testing: essential for sustained execution of the above

During our Lunch & Learn, Randy Syring, Chief Executive Developer at Level 12, will explore how an Agile approach is designed specifically to protect the ROI of a project and to overcome the risks associated with custom software development using a traditional model.  There will be time left for Q&A and Randy will be available after the event to chat one-on-one with participants regarding their specific situations.
